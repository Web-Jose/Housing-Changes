          <p>
            This week I tried to do some research in different aspects of future
            projects. I spent some time looking at other housing websites but
            some universities don't have a dedicated housing website. The ones
            that do have a dedicated housing website are very styled more
            academically than ours. Virtual tours are still being used by some
            universities but they are not as popular as they were before. I also
            tried finding a reliable events calendar for the university so that
            we can possible make event signage for the TVs. I found a few but I
            am not sure if you would want to display open out of housing events
            on the TVs. We can even collaborate with the collegian to create a
            signage showing the latest articles. I am still gathering research
            for the parking page but that should be done by next week.

            There was only one event added this week, but it was cleared off the

            I will be adding them as they come in.

          <p>
            I uploaded the Clothing Signage to the TVs. I will be taking it down
            after the 15th of December. They didn't provide a signage, only a
            flyer, so I quickly moved the information into a signage.

          <p>
            I removed the Thanksgiving Signage from the TVs and readded the Menu
            Signage. The menu was taken down as it would just be display closed,
            but since the dining hall is open again, I readded it.

          <p>
            This is a work in progress, but I am creating a page about parking
            at housing. Our connecting to the wifi page is one of our most
            visited pages, so I am trying to create more pages like it. Pages
            that are useful to students and that they will visit often.

          <h4>Deactived Plugin Automatic Responsive Tables</h4>
          <p>
            I deactivated the plugin Automatic Responsive Tables as it was
            causing issues with the tables on the website. When in use it would
            cause tables on tablet and mobile to be bright red and blue and
            would not display the table correctly. After it was deactivated
            tables were displaying correctly again.
