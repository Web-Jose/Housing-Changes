          <p>
            This was a short week due to the Labor Day holiday. This week I
            tried to work on or complete small projects that I could finish in a
            day or two. I made updates to the PHP code used to update our menu
            information. I added SEO keywords and web snippets to several pages.
            I added and removed Haley's RHA meeting signage to our digital
            signage system. I created the first real article for the bulldog
            living page. I created a tutorial page for doing laundry here at
            housing. I took a 360 view of the side of Homan Hall and uploaded it
            to Google Maps. I will be taking more 360 views of the buildings and
            uploading them to Google Maps. I will also be taking 360 views of
            the inside of the buildings and uploading them to Google Maps. This
            will allow people to see what the buildings and possibly rooms look
            like before they move in.

          <p>
            There is a small issue with the menu updater, that isn't allowing it
            to be parsed correctly. I will be working on fixing that next week.
            I am unsure about the times each menu is served, so for the time
            being I removed the times from the menu. I will add them back once I
            know what they are. I made some changes to the code used to change
            out the menu information to be more efficient and use a lot less
            code. I am keeping track of when new menus are added to the Fresno
            State site so that I can figure out when to schedule the menu
            updater to run.

          <p>
            Using my phone I went to the side of Homan Hall and took a 360 view
            of the side of the building. I uploaded it to Google Maps and it is
            now live. I will be taking more 360 views of the buildings and
            uploading them to Google Maps. I will also be taking 360 views of
            the inside of the buildings and uploading them to Google Maps. This
            will allow people to see what the buildings and possibly rooms look
            like before they move in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The end goal is to have a virtual tour of all of housing. This will
            take some time and will be planned around the weather, maintenance,
            and other projects happening around housing. You may notice that
            there are some small mistakes in the 360 view such as mis-aligned
            fences and other small things. I will be fixing those as I go along.

          <p>
            I created the first real article for the bulldog living page. I used
            ChatGPT to generate the article. It took a few tries to get an
            article that had the right vibe for something a student would read.
            I will be adding more articles as I go along. I will also be adding
            more images to the articles to make them look better. As we did not
            have many images from that night, I used the flyer for the featured
            image.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you may notice the other sections of the page are still empty. We
            don't have any events coming up and I am looking into a reliable
            event calendar to use for content. I removed all the placer content
            from the page.

            This is the article that was generated by ChatGPT. I added some
            images to make it flow better. In the future there will be a
            slideshow or button where residents can download the images from the
            event. As I put together more articles I will be updating the
            placeholder for other articles with the new articles. I feel that
            it's a thin line to walk with ChatGPT between entertaining and
            engaging to cringy and over the top. I will be working on finding
            the right balance for our articles.

          <h4>Laundry Tutorial Page</h4>
          <p>
            I am working on creating a tutorial page for doing laundry here at
            housing, it is based on our pdf version of the tutorial. I am
            working on making it more interactive and easier to follow. Using
            images of our laundry rooms and screenshots of the app, I hope to
            achieve that. This should replace the pdf version of the tutorial by
            the end of next week.
