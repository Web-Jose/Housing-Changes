            This week had me away from my desk a lot, but I was still able to

          <h4>2nd Interviews for Web Designer Position</h4>
          <p>
            We had the 2nd round of interviews for the Web Designer position
            this week. It was a great experience to be on the other side of the
            table and to see the process from a different perspective. We had
            some great candidates, and I think we made the right choice in the
            end. As their start date is unclear, I will continue preparing the
            manual and the website for the next person who takes over my
            position.

          <h4>Implementing a 4-point spacing system</h4>
          <p>
            I have been conducting research on UI and UX design and recently
            came across a 4-point spacing system that I think will be very
            useful. I am going to implement this system on a few pages to see
            how it looks and how it affects the overall design. I think it will
            help to make the pages look more organized and professional.

            I hadn't realized that the Instagram feed on the website and the TVs
            in the lobby had stopped displaying. I reauthenticated the Instagram
            feed for the website and the dynamic signage. I am glad that I was
            able to fix this issue quickly and that everything is back up and
            running smoothly.

            I have been working on updating the content for the manual to make
            it easier to understand. I have been trying to make sure that
            everything is clear and concise so that the person who takes over my
            position will be able to understand everything that they need to
            know. I have been working on this for a while now, and I am making a
            lot of progress.

            I updated the survey for staff about the website to get feedback on
            what they think needs to be improved. I have been getting some great
            feedback, and I am excited to see what they have to say. I think
            that this will help me to make the website better and to make it
            more user-friendly for everyone who uses it. It will also be a great
            resource for the person who takes over my position.
